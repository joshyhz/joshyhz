### Hi there 👋

I'm a freelance developer fully embracing the life of remote work 🏝️

Full-stack expertise primarily in JavaScript-based environments. Express.js, Next.js, React, Angular.

Getting into the open-source world and giving back!

If there's a library you're looking for but doesn't exist yet, hit me up! I might be interested in building it out 👀
